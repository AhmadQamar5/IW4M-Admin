#### Player Identification
All players are identified 4 ways   
1. `npID/GUID/XUID` - The ID corresponding to the player's hardware or forum account   
2. `IP` - The player's IP Address   
3. `Database ID` - The internal reference to a player, generated by IW4MAdmin   
4. `Name` - The visible player name as it appears in game   

For most commands players are identified by their `Name`  
However, if they are currently offline, or their name contains un-typable characters, a `Database ID` must be used   

The `dbID` is specified by prefixing a player's reference number with `@`.  
For example, `@123` would reference the player with a `dbID` of 123.  
Players can also be referenced by `clientID`, which is simply their slot (0 - 17)

**All commands that require a `target` look at the `first argument` for a form of player identification**


#### Additional Command Parameters
`setlevel`
- _shortcut_ - `sl`
- _Parameter 1_ - Player to modify level of
- _Parameter 2_ - Level to set the player to ```[ User, Trusted, Moderator, Administrator, SeniorAdmin ]```
- _Example_ - `!setlevel Player1 SeniorAdmin`, `!sl @123 Moderator`
- **NOTE** - It has been purposefully designed that there should only be **1 Owner** ( owner cannot set another player's level to owner unless the configuration option is enabled during setup)

`ban`
- _Shortcut_ - `b`
- _Parameter 1_ - Player to ban
- _Parameter 2_ - Reason for ban
- _Example_ - `!ban Player1 caught cheating`, `!b @123 GUID Spoofing`

`reports`  
- _Shortcut_ - `reps`
- _Optional Parameter 1_ - `clear` (erases reports for current server)

### Plugins
#### EventAPI
- This plugin adds a page to the webfront that serves JSON content in the form of server events   
- The page is located at 127.0.0.1/api/events
- JSON Object Structure
 	* **eventCount** - Number of events in the generated response ( 0 or 1 )
 	* **Event** - The event object corresponding to generated event ( will be null if eventCount = 0 )
 	  * _Version_ - The supported version of the Event Object ( IW4MAdmin = 0 )
 	  * _Type_ - The type of Event Object ( Notification = 0, Status = 1, Alert = 2 )
 	  * _Message_ - The string contents of the Event Object ( ie chat message text )
 	  * _Title_ - The string header/title of the Event Object ( optional )
 	  * _Origin_ - The string origin of the Event Object ( ie player name or sv_hostname )
 	  * _Target_ - The string target of the Event Object ( ie reported player's name )
 	  * _ID_ - The int ID of the Event Object ( will be unique unless two events are generated simultaneously )
- Optional Parameters 
  * appending a `GET` parameter of `status=1` to your request will generate a list of currently monitored servers
  * For example: 127.0.0.1/api/events?status=1
  * The contents of the response will be in the `Message` property of the response
- Each event will be consumed ( eaten by the request, so save the event if you need to use it later )

- If enough matching phrases are detected, an alert will be generated
- No commands are added by this plugin
- Additional Features will be added in the future
